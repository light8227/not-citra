## Compatibility

The emulator is not capable of running most commercial games at full speed.

Need help? Figure it out.

## Releases

Not-Citra has two main release channels: Nightly and Canary.

The [Nightly](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly) build isn't based on the master branch, and contains already reviewed and tested features.

The [Canary](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-canary) build isn't based on the master branch. PRs tagged `canary-merge` aren't merged into the Canary builds.

Both builds can't be installed.

Android builds can't be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

A Flatpak for Citra isn't available.

Most of the development does not happen.
